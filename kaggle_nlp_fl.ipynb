       "xxbos paris in the springtime was , is and always will be , something rather special . why not experience it for yourself with this excellent break for four days ? this attractive city has something to offer to everyone and with prices at just ps129 . your break begins with comfortable bus transfer from local pick - up points and travel to paris is via cross - channel ferry , arriving at your hotel in the evening . the ibis is an excellent quality hotel with private equipments in all rooms : satellite tv , radio , telephone and alarm clock . it has a bar and restaurant and is situated about two miles south of notre dame enabling you to explore paris with ease . the following day , after continental breakfast ( included ) , the bus takes you on a comprehensive sightseeing tour of the city , during which you will see the eiffel tower , champs elysees , l'arc de triomphe , the louvre , in fact almost every famous landmark you have ever heard of . you then leave paris and take a short drive to the magnificent palace of versailles , the home of louis xiv . the tour ends mid - afternoon back in paris where you will have the remainder of the day at your leisure . in the evening there is a ` ` paris by night '' tour showing you the beautiful buildings with bright lights . day three takes you to xxunk , perhaps the most attractive quarter of paris and home of the sacre coeur and the moulin rouge . in the afternoon you are free to explore this beautiful city as you wish , perhaps a pleasure voyage on the river seine , wander around the beautiful gardens or look among the antique shops . in the evening you will have the opportunity to visit the best nightclub in the city , the splendid xxunk xxunk . on the final day it 's back to the uk via channel ferry . included in the price of ps129 per person : * return comfortable bus travel to paris * return ferry crossings * 3 nights housing in a twin bedded room in a central paris hotel with private facilities * continental breakfast during your stay * guided sightseeing tour of ` ` paris by day '' and paris by night '' * visit to the chateau of versailles ( admission not included ) * tour around montmartre * services of experienced bi - lingual tour guide at all times,xxbos drunken driving -sometimes called america 's socially accepted form of murder -- has become a national epidemic . every hour of every day about three americans on average are killed by drunken drivers , adding up to an incredible 250,000 over the past ten years . a drunken driver is usually referred to as one with xxunk alcohol content or roughly three beer glasses of wine or shots of whisky drunk within two hours . heavy drinking used to be an acceptable part of the american manly image and judges were in most courts , but the drunken killing has recently caused so many well - publicized tragedies , especially concerning young children , that public opinion is no longer so tolerant . twenty states have raised the legal drinking age to 21 , reversing a trend in the 1960s to reduce it to 18 . after new jersey lowered it to 18 , the number of people killed by 18 - 20 years old drivers more than doubled , so the state recently upped it back to 21 . reformers , however , fear raising the drinking age will have little effect unless accompanied by educational programs to help young people to develop ' responsible attitudes ' about drinking and teach them to resist peer pressure to drink . though new laws have led to increased arrests and tests in many areas already , to a marked drop in accidents , some states are also punishing bars for serving customers too many drinks . a bar in massachusetts was fined for serving six or more double xxunk to a customer who was ' obviously drunk ' and later drove off the road , killing a 9-year - old boy . as the accidents continue to occur daily in every state , some americans are even beginning to speak well of the 13 years national prohibition of alcohol that began in 1919 , which president hoover called the ' noble experiment ' . they forgot that legal prohibition did n't stop drinking , but encouraged political corruption and organized crime . as with the booming drug trade generally , there is no easy solution .,xxbos by 2050 , half of the world 's population will live in the tropics -- the ly warm belt that circles the globe -- according to state of the tropics , a report released today . rapid population growth , along with economic growth , means that the region 's influence will grow in coming decades , the authors of the xxunk work predict . the project , first launched in 2011 , aimed to answer one significant question : is life in the tropics improving ? to find out , the researchers analyzed environmental , social , and economic indicators collected over 6 decades . it finds that the region has made ` ` extraordinary progress '' in many areas . for example , more people have access to safe drinking water , and the number of protected areas is increasing . the tropics also have outperformed the rest of the world in economic growth over the past 30 years . however , some challenges remain . investment in research and development , for example , has increased cautiously , but tropical nations still invest less than the rest of the world . ` ` as a proportion of gdp the rest of the world invests almost four times as much in research and development than the tropics . '' concludes the report . the report also includes a new analysis of how climate change will affect the region . many plant and animal species are moving xxunk in an attempt to stay within their preferred environmental conditions in the tropics , the authors write . however , some organisms may not be able to keep pace with the changing conditions , they predict . as a result , they can experience population declines or go extinct . in addition , an expanded tropical zone also threatens health and safety issues , the authors warn . as regions become more suitable to insects such as mosquitoes and ticks , the spread of insect - borne diseases such as malaria , dengue , and xxunk disease could rise , causing a burden to human health and the economy . xxunk , a researcher , says he sees a lot to be concerned about in the report . ` ` while we ' ve made incredible advances in some areas , i think the risks for the tropics that are highlighted in this report are things that we really need to be concerned about . '',xxbos 3d printers are certainly the superstar today -- -they are being put to all kinds of uses , including creating model cars for movies . however , none of these ideas are as crazy as the one suggested by anjan contractor , who believes that they will be the key to ending world hunger . if you think that sounds a little crazy , you are not the only one , but after hearing scientists , the idea seems to become true . according to scientists , food will become _ expensive and possibly , even out of reach , for billions of people in the future . it means billions of people wo n't have enough food . this is where 3d printers may save the day . anjan , an engineer says that the only way to support the large population will be to provide every kitchen with a 3d printer and print out meals . more importantly , it would be to make the basic food from things that we now do not think can be eaten . anjan thinks that we could easily get the meat protein from insects . similarly , the vegetable nutrition could be made from greens like grass . would you want to try 3d printed food ?,xxbos i can still remember it as if it happened yesterday . i was a college freshman and had stayed up most of the night before laughing and talking with friends . now just before my first class of the day my eyelids were feeling heavier and heavier and my head was drifting down to my desk to make my textbook a pillow . a few minutes ' nap time before class could n't hurt , i thought . boom ! i lifted my head immediately and my eyes opened wider than saucers . i looked around with my heart beating quickly trying to find the cause of the noise . my young professor was looking back at me with a _ , boyish smile on his face . he had intentionally dropped the pile of textbooks he was carrying onto my desk . ` ` good morning ! '' he said , still smiling . ` ` i ' m glad to see everyone is awake . now let 's get started . '' for the next hour i was n't sleepy at all . it was n't from the shock of my professor 's textbook alarm clock either . instead , it was from the attractive discussion he led . with knowledge and good humor , he made the material come alive . his insights were full of both wisdom and loving kindness . and the enthusiasm and joy that he taught with were contagious . i left the classroom not only wide awake , but a little smarter and a little better as well . i learned something far more important than not sleeping in class that day too . i learned that if you are going to do something in this life , do it well , do it with joy , and make it an expression of your love . what a glorious place this world would be if all of us did our work joyously and well ! what a beautiful world we could create if every doctor , teacher , musician , cook , waitress , poet , miner , farmer , and laborer made their work an expression of their love ! do n't sleepwalk your way through life then . wake up ! let your love fill your work and your soul . life is too short not to live it well .\n",

       "xxbos paris in the springtime was , is and always will be , something rather special . why not experience it for yourself with this excellent break for four days ? this attractive city has something to offer to everyone and with prices at just ps129 . your break begins with comfortable bus transfer from local pick - up points and travel to paris is via cross - channel ferry , arriving at your hotel in the evening . the ibis is an excellent quality hotel with private equipments in all rooms : satellite tv , radio , telephone and alarm clock . it has a bar and restaurant and is situated about two miles south of notre dame enabling you to explore paris with ease . the following day , after continental breakfast ( included ) , the bus takes you on a comprehensive sightseeing tour of the city , during which you will see the eiffel tower , champs elysees , l'arc de triomphe , the louvre , in fact almost every famous landmark you have ever heard of . you then leave paris and take a short drive to the magnificent palace of versailles , the home of louis xiv . the tour ends mid - afternoon back in paris where you will have the remainder of the day at your leisure . in the evening there is a ` ` paris by night '' tour showing you the beautiful buildings with bright lights . day three takes you to xxunk , perhaps the most attractive quarter of paris and home of the sacre coeur and the moulin rouge . in the afternoon you are free to explore this beautiful city as you wish , perhaps a pleasure voyage on the river seine , wander around the beautiful gardens or look among the antique shops . in the evening you will have the opportunity to visit the best nightclub in the city , the splendid xxunk xxunk . on the final day it 's back to the uk via channel ferry . included in the price of ps129 per person : * return comfortable bus travel to paris * return ferry crossings * 3 nights housing in a twin bedded room in a central paris hotel with private facilities * continental breakfast during your stay * guided sightseeing tour of ` ` paris by day '' and paris by night '' * visit to the chateau of versailles ( admission not included ) * tour around montmartre * services of experienced bi - lingual tour guide at all times,xxbos drunken driving -sometimes called america 's socially accepted form of murder -- has become a national epidemic . every hour of every day about three americans on average are killed by drunken drivers , adding up to an incredible 250,000 over the past ten years . a drunken driver is usually referred to as one with xxunk alcohol content or roughly three beer glasses of wine or shots of whisky drunk within two hours . heavy drinking used to be an acceptable part of the american manly image and judges were in most courts , but the drunken killing has recently caused so many well - publicized tragedies , especially concerning young children , that public opinion is no longer so tolerant . twenty states have raised the legal drinking age to 21 , reversing a trend in the 1960s to reduce it to 18 . after new jersey lowered it to 18 , the number of people killed by 18 - 20 years old drivers more than doubled , so the state recently upped it back to 21 . reformers , however , fear raising the drinking age will have little effect unless accompanied by educational programs to help young people to develop ' responsible attitudes ' about drinking and teach them to resist peer pressure to drink . though new laws have led to increased arrests and tests in many areas already , to a marked drop in accidents , some states are also punishing bars for serving customers too many drinks . a bar in massachusetts was fined for serving six or more double xxunk to a customer who was ' obviously drunk ' and later drove off the road , killing a 9-year - old boy . as the accidents continue to occur daily in every state , some americans are even beginning to speak well of the 13 years national prohibition of alcohol that began in 1919 , which president hoover called the ' noble experiment ' . they forgot that legal prohibition did n't stop drinking , but encouraged political corruption and organized crime . as with the booming drug trade generally , there is no easy solution .,xxbos by 2050 , half of the world 's population will live in the tropics -- the ly warm belt that circles the globe -- according to state of the tropics , a report released today . rapid population growth , along with economic growth , means that the region 's influence will grow in coming decades , the authors of the xxunk work predict . the project , first launched in 2011 , aimed to answer one significant question : is life in the tropics improving ? to find out , the researchers analyzed environmental , social , and economic indicators collected over 6 decades . it finds that the region has made ` ` extraordinary progress '' in many areas . for example , more people have access to safe drinking water , and the number of protected areas is increasing . the tropics also have outperformed the rest of the world in economic growth over the past 30 years . however , some challenges remain . investment in research and development , for example , has increased cautiously , but tropical nations still invest less than the rest of the world . ` ` as a proportion of gdp the rest of the world invests almost four times as much in research and development than the tropics . '' concludes the report . the report also includes a new analysis of how climate change will affect the region . many plant and animal species are moving xxunk in an attempt to stay within their preferred environmental conditions in the tropics , the authors write . however , some organisms may not be able to keep pace with the changing conditions , they predict . as a result , they can experience population declines or go extinct . in addition , an expanded tropical zone also threatens health and safety issues , the authors warn . as regions become more suitable to insects such as mosquitoes and ticks , the spread of insect - borne diseases such as malaria , dengue , and xxunk disease could rise , causing a burden to human health and the economy . xxunk , a researcher , says he sees a lot to be concerned about in the report . ` ` while we ' ve made incredible advances in some areas , i think the risks for the tropics that are highlighted in this report are things that we really need to be concerned about . '',xxbos 3d printers are certainly the superstar today -- -they are being put to all kinds of uses , including creating model cars for movies . however , none of these ideas are as crazy as the one suggested by anjan contractor , who believes that they will be the key to ending world hunger . if you think that sounds a little crazy , you are not the only one , but after hearing scientists , the idea seems to become true . according to scientists , food will become _ expensive and possibly , even out of reach , for billions of people in the future . it means billions of people wo n't have enough food . this is where 3d printers may save the day . anjan , an engineer says that the only way to support the large population will be to provide every kitchen with a 3d printer and print out meals . more importantly , it would be to make the basic food from things that we now do not think can be eaten . anjan thinks that we could easily get the meat protein from insects . similarly , the vegetable nutrition could be made from greens like grass . would you want to try 3d printed food ?,xxbos i can still remember it as if it happened yesterday . i was a college freshman and had stayed up most of the night before laughing and talking with friends . now just before my first class of the day my eyelids were feeling heavier and heavier and my head was drifting down to my desk to make my textbook a pillow . a few minutes ' nap time before class could n't hurt , i thought . boom ! i lifted my head immediately and my eyes opened wider than saucers . i looked around with my heart beating quickly trying to find the cause of the noise . my young professor was looking back at me with a _ , boyish smile on his face . he had intentionally dropped the pile of textbooks he was carrying onto my desk . ` ` good morning ! '' he said , still smiling . ` ` i ' m glad to see everyone is awake . now let 's get started . '' for the next hour i was n't sleepy at all . it was n't from the shock of my professor 's textbook alarm clock either . instead , it was from the attractive discussion he led . with knowledge and good humor , he made the material come alive . his insights were full of both wisdom and loving kindness . and the enthusiasm and joy that he taught with were contagious . i left the classroom not only wide awake , but a little smarter and a little better as well . i learned something far more important than not sleeping in class that day too . i learned that if you are going to do something in this life , do it well , do it with joy , and make it an expression of your love . what a glorious place this world would be if all of us did our work joyously and well ! what a beautiful world we could create if every doctor , teacher , musician , cook , waitress , poet , miner , farmer , and laborer made their work an expression of their love ! do n't sleepwalk your way through life then . wake up ! let your love fill your work and your soul . life is too short not to live it well .\n",
